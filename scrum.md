## Waffle.io with GitHub  

Projects are managed using [Waffle.io](https://waffle.io) with [GitHub](https://github.com), a free project management solution powered by real time [GitHub issues](https://help.github.com/articles/about-issues/) and [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). Status updates are automatic.  

[Take a look at the nothingworksright projects on Waffle.io](https://waffle.io/nothingworksright?tab=projects)  
[Read the Waffle.io recommended workflow using pull requests and automatic work tracking](https://github.com/waffleio/waffle.io/wiki/Recommended-Workflow-Using-Pull-Requests-&-Automatic-Work-Tracking)  

## Workflow  

### Product Backlog Items (PBI)  

Product owner creates the __product backlog items__ by creating [GitHub issues](https://help.github.com/articles/about-issues/).  

Team conducts the __backlog refinement meeting__ and prioritizes the issues. Priorities and other attributes are set by applying labels to the issues. Priorities include:

Priority|Description
---|---
DEFCON1|Highest priority. A solution is needed imminently, maximum attention!
DEFCON2|High priority. A solution to this is needed soon, no dillydallying.
DEFCON3|Increased priority. A solution to this is requested, and please hurry this one.
DEFCON4|Normal priority. A solution to this is requested, but no hurry.
DEFCON5|Lowest priority. A solution to this would be nice someday.

### Sprint Planning  

Team conducts the __sprint planning meeting__, choosing issues to be worked during the sprint and [assigning them to team members](https://help.github.com/articles/assigning-issues-and-pull-requests-to-other-github-users/).  

Issues chosen for the sprint are given estimated __story points__ using the [Waffle.io card size](https://github.com/waffleio/waffle.io/wiki/FAQs#planning-and-estimation-1).  

[Branches are created](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/) for each issue, including the issue number in the branch name (e.g. `docs-#4`).  

### Sprints  

Sprints are one month.  

__Daily scrum__ meetings (stand-ups) happen at the start of each day, and all updates are documented as comments to the issues.  

### Sprint Review and Retrospective

At the end of the sprint, pull requests are issued for each branch using the [special keyword syntax](https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests) to close the related issue once the pull request has been successfully merged.  

Results of the sprint are reviewed by the team and documented as comments to the issues or pull requests.  

Pull requests are merged if ready.
