## Waffle.io with GitHub  

Projects are managed using [Waffle.io](https://waffle.io) with [GitHub](https://github.com), a free project management solution powered by real time [GitHub issues](https://help.github.com/articles/about-issues/) and [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). Status updates are automatic.

## Workflow  

Product owner creates the product backlog by creating [GitHub issues](https://help.github.com/articles/about-issues/).  

Product owner prioritizes the issues. Priorities include:  

Priority|Description
---|---
DEFCON1|Highest priority. A solution is needed imminently, maximum attention!
DEFCON2|High priority. A solution to this is needed soon, no dillydallying.
DEFCON3|Increased priority. A solution to this is requested, and please hurry this one.
DEFCON4|Normal priority. A solution to this is requested, but no hurry.
DEFCON5|Lowest priority. A solution to this would be nice someday.

Team conducts sprint planning, choosing issues and assigning them to team members.  

Sprints are one month by default.
