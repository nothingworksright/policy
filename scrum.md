## Waffle.io with GitHub  

Projects are managed using [Waffle.io](https://waffle.io) with [GitHub](https://github.com), a free project management solution powered by real time [GitHub issues](https://help.github.com/articles/about-issues/) and [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). Status updates are automatic.

## Workflow  

#### Product backlog items  

Product owner creates the __product backlog items__ by creating [GitHub issues](https://help.github.com/articles/about-issues/).  

Team conducts the __backlog refinement meeting__ and prioritizes the issues by applying labels. Priorities include:

Priority|Description
---|---
DEFCON1|Highest priority. A solution is needed imminently, maximum attention!
DEFCON2|High priority. A solution to this is needed soon, no dillydallying.
DEFCON3|Increased priority. A solution to this is requested, and please hurry this one.
DEFCON4|Normal priority. A solution to this is requested, but no hurry.
DEFCON5|Lowest priority. A solution to this would be nice someday.

#### Sprint planning  

Team conducts the __sprint planning meeting__, choosing issues to be addressed during the sprint and [assigning them to team members](https://help.github.com/articles/assigning-issues-and-pull-requests-to-other-github-users/).  

Issues chosen for the sprint are given estimated __story points__ using the [Waffle.io card size](https://github.com/waffleio/waffle.io/wiki/FAQs#planning-and-estimation-1).  

Branches are created for each issue, including the issue number in the branch name.  

#### Sprints  

Sprints are one month by default.  
__Daily scrum__ updates are documented as comments to the issues.  

#### Sprint review and retrospective

At the end of the sprint, pull requests are issued for each branch using the [special keyword syntax](https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests) to close the related issue once the pull request has been successfully merged.  

Results of the sprint are reviewed by the team and documented as comments to the issues or pull requests.  

Pull requests are merged if ready.
